At this time, I am not able to provide you with ONMS permit guidance until you are able to provide the FKNMS permits office with a SAL. Once / if you are able to obtain a SAL, I will also need to know the specific locations you are requesting to collect from (i.e., 4 GPS points that connect to create a polygon), especially if the collections will take place in Key Largo or Looe Key Existing Management Areas (which I would try to avoid conducting in for ease of permitting).\nPlease let me know once you obtain the SAL, or if FWC is able to provide you with information / guidance on whether this would be possible & issued in your requested timeline and we can proceed from there to apply for the ONMS permit.\nAll the best,\nDr. Harrison\n\nTo collect fish samples along the Keys outside of these special zones, no FKNMS permit is necessary. These permits seem to be especially important for any work disturbing the seafloor such as coral coring, for example, but to just spear some fish we should be good! See this email from Kyle Phillips, a scientist at the Keys Marine Laboratory in Layton, FL:\n\nYou should only need a FKNMS permit if you wish to collect specimens within special areas such as SPAs, ERs, or ROAs that’re within the sanctuary. My initial thoughts are that this won’t be necessary, we can hopefully find these fish at patch reefs outside of these special areas (still within the sanctuary), so it’s likely you’ll just need the SAL from FWC. … Just to clarify the sanctuary stuff, all sites that we would take you to are within the FKNMS. It’s just that with fish collections, you’d only need a FKNMS permit if you were disturbing the seafloor or collecting in a ‘special area’ like a ROA, ER, etc (which we shouldn’t need to do).

Incubate until the liquid is clear.\n4.17 Transfer 20 µL of supernatant to a new plate/tube(s) to proceed with Library Amplification (step 5)\n\n\n\n\nThe KAPA Library Amplification Primer Mix (10X) is designed to eliminate or delay primer depletion during library amplification reactions performed with KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix. The primer mix is suitable for the amplification of all Illumina libraries flanked by the P5 and P7 flow cell sequences. Primers are supplied at a 10X concentration of 20 μM each, and have been formulated as described below. User-supplied primer mixes may be used in combination with incomplete or custom adapters. Please contact Technical Support at sequencing.roche.com/support for guidelines on the formulation of user-supplied library amplification primers.\n• To achieve the highest amplification efficiency and avoid primer depletion, it is critical to use an optimal concentration of high-quality primers. Primers should be used at a final concentration of 0.5 – 4 μM each. For libraries constructed from ≥100 ng input DNA, a final concentration of at least 2 μM of each primer is recommended.\n• Library amplification primers should be HPLC-purified and modified to include a phosphorothioate bond at the 3’-terminal of each primer (to prevent degradation by the strong proofreading activity of KAPA HiFi HotStart). Always store and dilute primers in a buffered solution (e.g., 10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0–8.5), and limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles. To achieve the latter, store primers at 2°C to 8°C for short-term use, or as single-use aliquots at -15°C to -25°C.\n\n5.1 Assemble each library amplification reaction as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nVolume\n1/3 Volume\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nKAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (2X)\n25 µL\n8.3 µL\n\n\n\nLibrary Amplification Primer Mix (10X)*\n5 µL\n1.7 µL\nif using custon Primers i5/i7 they should be at [20µM]\n\n\nAdapter-ligated library\n20 µL\n6.7 µL\n\n\n\n——————–\n——\n——\n——\n\n\nTotal Volume\n50 µL\n16.7 µL\n\n\n\n\n** NOTE: keep Adapter ligated library extra just in case **\n\n5.2 Mix thoroughly and centrifuge briefly.\n5.3 Amplify using the following cycling protocol:\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTemp\nTime\nCycles\n\n\n\n\nInitial Denaturation\n98°C\n45 sec\n1\n\n\nDenaturation\n98°C\n15 sec\n\n\n\nAnnealing\n60°C\n30 sec\n8X\n\n\nExtension\n72°C\n30 sec\n\n\n\nFinal Extension\n72°C\n1 min\n1\n\n\nHOLD\n4°C\n∞\n1\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Proceed directly to Post-amplification Cleanup (step 6).\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT- Only do this the first time and check your library.

    "text": "The KAPA Library Amplification Primer Mix (10X) is designed to eliminate or delay primer depletion during library amplification reactions performed with KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix. The primer mix is suitable for the amplification of all Illumina libraries flanked by the P5 and P7 flow cell sequences. Primers are supplied at a 10X concentration of 20 μM each, and have been formulated as described below. User-supplied primer mixes may be used in combination with incomplete or custom adapters. Please contact Technical Support at sequencing.roche.com/support for guidelines on the formulation of user-supplied library amplification primers.\n• To achieve the highest amplification efficiency and avoid primer depletion, it is critical to use an optimal concentration of high-quality primers. Primers should be used at a final concentration of 0.5 – 4 μM each. For libraries constructed from ≥100 ng input DNA, a final concentration of at least 2 μM of each primer is recommended.\n• Library amplification primers should be HPLC-purified and modified to include a phosphorothioate bond at the 3’-terminal of each primer (to prevent degradation by the strong proofreading activity of KAPA HiFi HotStart). Always store and dilute primers in a buffered solution (e.g., 10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0–8.5), and limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles. To achieve the latter, store primers at 2°C to 8°C for short-term use, or as single-use aliquots at -15°C to -25°C.\n\n5.1 Assemble each library amplification reaction as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nVolume\n1/3 Volume\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nKAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (2X)\n25 µL\n8.3 µL\n\n\n\nLibrary Amplification Primer Mix (10X)*\n5 µL\n1.7 µL\nif using custon Primers i5/i7 they should be at [20µM]\n\n\nAdapter-ligated library\n20 µL\n6.7 µL\n\n\n\n——————–\n——\n——\n——\n\n\nTotal Volume\n50 µL\n16.7 µL\n\n\n\n\n** NOTE: keep Adapter ligated library extra just in case **\n\n5.2 Mix thoroughly and centrifuge briefly.\n5.3 Amplify using the following cycling protocol:\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTemp\nTime\nCycles\n\n\n\n\nInitial Denaturation\n98°C\n45 sec\n1\n\n\nDenaturation\n98°C\n15 sec\n\n\n\nAnnealing\n60°C\n30 sec\n8X\n\n\nExtension\n72°C\n30 sec\n\n\n\nFinal Extension\n72°C\n1 min\n1\n\n\nHOLD\n4°C\n∞\n1\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Proceed directly to Post-amplification Cleanup (step 6).",

Each well has an alpha-numeric position (rows A - H, columns 1-12), thus the first well is A1, the next A2, and so on.\nOnce the capsule is in the plate, you can put the rest of the powder away by scooping it back into the vial from the weighing dish and returning the vial to its original position. Then clean the weighing dish and other tools.\n\n\nPut both the cell plates and trays of micro-centrifuge tubes containing remaining tissue back in a closed desiccation chamber until you are ready to send them to be processed.\n\n\n\nLabel the plate with:\n\nPI first/last name\nNortheastern University Marine Science Center\nProject title\nTray n / n\nPI contact into (email and cell)\n\nWhen all samples are ready to be sent out, contact Bob Michener at BU about sending them or bringing them to the BU stable isotope lab\n\nBUSIL-EA-Sample-Submission.xls\nIf you have any questions about the process, you can message Fin or Alice on Slack.",

    "text": "Edit this page Protocol adapted from Lotterhos lab protocol\n\n\nYou can make either a 1% or 2% agarose gel. We have been using 2% gels because they tend to give better/clearer results.\nMaterials\n\nAgarose (chemical shelf)\n1X TAE (reagent shelf)\nScoop (near sink)\nErlenmeyer flask (glassware cabinet)\nStir bar (drawer under stir plate)\nGel rig and combs (gel room)\nWeigh boat\nParafilm\n1kb Plus ladder (-20 freezer)\nTriTrack loading dye (-20 freezer)\nDI water\nMilliQ water (OGL)\nP2.5 and P10 pipettes\nInsulated box with ice\n\nEquipment\n\nMagnetic stir plate (left of the -80 fridge)\nMicrowave (gel room)\nPower supply- PowerEase™ Touch 120W Power Supply (115 VAC) or Hoefer PS300-B (in gel room)\n\nPowerEase™ Touch 120W Power Supply (115 VAC) User Manual\n\nGel Doc for imaging (in OGL)\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you have correctly diluted 1X TAE Buffer. To make 1X from 50X TAE, pour 20mL 10X TAE in the large plastic graduated cyliner. Add 980mL MilliQ water until the mixture reaches the 1000mL mark. Pour and store in a 1L labelled glass bottle.\nMix the gel components.\n\nFor a 1% agarose gel:\n\nSmall gel: 0.60g agarose + 60 mL 1X TAE Buffer\nMedium gel: 1 g agarose + 100 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nFor a 2% agarose gel (what we usually use):\n\nSmall gel: 1.2g agarose + 60 mL 1X TAE Buffer\nMedium gel: 2g agarose + 100 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nWeigh agarose using a plastic small weigh boat. Pour into Erlenmeyer flask. Measure 1X TAE using an 100mL graduated cyliner. Pour into Erlenmeyer flask and swirl gently.\nUse the magnetic stirring plate (put a stir bar inside the Erlenmeyer flask) to mix. Turn the RPM into the 500s until all the clumps are gone. Remove the stir bar using the magnetic pull from another stir bar. Sterilize before putting back.\n\nMelt the gel.\n\nMicrowave the flask with agarose mixture for ~30 seconds.\n\nAlways watch for boiling. If mixture begins to bubble, remove it immediately and carefully swirl until bubbles are gone.\n\nWith hot mitt, remove the flask from microwave and gently swirl.\n\nBe careful—it will be hot! Hold the flask away from you and gently swirl to avoid splashing.\n\nReturn the flask to microwave and continue heating for another 30-40 seconds until mixture is clear and there are no agarose particles.\n\nAllow to cool.\n\nGently swirl while cooling. The solution should be cool enough to hold in the palm of your hand. This can take a couple minutes, please be patient.\n\nAdd GelRed:\n\nSmall gel: 6ul.\nMedium gel: 10 uL\n\nGelRed can be found in the drawer labeled “Gatins GelRed” in the shared wet lab/gel room.\n\nGently swirl until the stain is dissolved (you should not be able to see any red stain in the gel).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelRed Info\n\n\n\nGelRed is light sentsitive, dont keep it out for long! It tends to form a bubble on top. Pop it with a seperate pipette tip before pipetting to ensure it doesn’t get all over the pipette.\n\n\n\nPour the gel.\n\nPlace gel tray in empty gel rig (dry, no TAE). Flip its orientation so it in confined (SEE IMAGE BELOW). Wet the red rubber gaskets of tray before placing in rig so it will be easier to take out later.\n\n\n\nb. Pour gel slowly to avoid bubbles. \n   i. If bubbles form, you can pop them using a pipette tip. \n   ii. Make sure gel is poured evenly. \nc. Add casting combs into the slots. \n   i. Allow enough room between combs for DNA to run down.\n   ii. There are 2 pairs of combs for each size gel; one will create wider wells than the other. You can use either set of combs. \nd. Rinse out the flask and hang on drying rack in Gatins lab.\n\nLet the gel set for ~40 minutes.\n\nThe gel should be solid, cool to the touch, and opaque.\nOnce gel is set, remove the combs.\n\nRemove combs slowly, pulling straight up. It might be easier to do this if the gel is in the buffer.\n\n\nMake sure that the power source is off, and the gel rig is unplugged from the power source before removing the top.\nPlace the tray with your gel in the gel rig with wells on the side with the black plug\n\nSamples will run from the black side toward red side.\nDNA “runs to red” \n\nFill rig with enough 1X TAE Buffer to just cover the entire gel.\n\nThe rig doesn’t need to be filled all the way to the line, just enough to cover the gel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading DNA into gel wells\n\n\n\nRight before taking your 3ul of DNA, make sure to vortex the sample to ensure DNA is evenly dispersed throughout the tube. Forgetting to vortex can result in gels where no band is visible, or super streaky, as DNA may be stuck on the bottom of the sample well rather than suspended in the buffer.\n\n\n\nCreate ladder and DNA dye/sample solutions to load.\n\nThaw DNA, ladder, and TriTrack loading dye. Keep on ice once thawed.\nCut a piece of parafilm and tape to blue tray, waxy side up. Label where samples will go.\nCreate ladder following table below. Vortex and centrifuge ladder before using.\n\n\n\n\nLadder\nLoading Dye\nDI H2O\n\n\n\n\n1 uL\n1 uL\n4 uL\n\n\n\nMakes enough for 2 ladders\nPipette the 1ul ladder, 1ul TriTrack loading dye, and 4ul DI H20 per 2 ladders onto parafilm.\nPipette up and down to mix.\n\nCreate DNA dye/sample solutions following table below.\n\n\n\n\nDNA\nLoading Dye\n\n\n\n\n3 uL\n1 uL\n\n\n\nPipette the 1uL loading dye onto parafilm for each sample.\nUsing filtered tips pipette DNA up and down when pipetting out. Pipette the 3 uL DNA onto parafilm.\nPipette DNA and loading dye up and down on parafilm to mix. \n\n\nLoad Gel\n\nPipette 3 ul of the dye/sample solution into the proper well of the gel.\nRepeat for each sample. Change your pipette tip for each sample.\nKeep track of which samples are where!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipetting into gel wells\n\n\n\nWhen pipetting into gel wells, be careful not to break the agarose or stick the pipette tip too far into the well so that the sample ejects into the agarose. Position your pipette tip just inside the well and check for dye in the correct well after you pipette it. Check to see if the agarose around the well breaks. Take a note if the agarose breaks around a well.\n\n\n\nRun the gel.\n\nPut the gel box cover into place.\n\nMake sure the wires are plugged in correctly (wire colors match plug colors).\nTurn on the power supply and set timer. For a 1% gel, set it for 130V for 30 minutes. For a 2% gel, we found that 90V for 35 minutes works better.\n\nCheck for bubbles rising at cathode (black plug) side to ensure the rig is working. If you do not see bubbles rising, the gel is not running.\nWhen the gel is done running, turn the off power.\n\nNever open the rig when the power is on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Power Supply Safety Notes\n\n\n\n\nThe power supply can output 300 V at maximum. Never run a protocol that maxes out the voltage.\nYou can safely run up to 4 small gels or 2 medium gels at most simultaneously on the power supply. Do not run more gels than the machine can handle, or it may break the machine.\nNever connect/disconnect cords from the power supply’s power jacks while the blue indicator light is on or when the screen says “Running.”\nMake sure area around the power supply is dry and clean\nWait 5 seconds after ending a run before handling the cords/output leads/gel rig.\nFor proper ventilation, leave at least 10 cm of space behind the instrument, and at least 5 cm of space on each side.\nInformation based on Appendix D of the safety manual\n\n\n\n\nVisualize the gel.\n\nTurn the power supply off.\nRemove the cover from the gel box.\nCarefully remove the tray and gel.\n\nTry to drip excess buffer back into the rig, scraping the bottom of the tray on the edge of the box.\n\nThe gel doc (for visualizing the gel) is in OGL, in the room you walk through right before the autoclave room. The gel doc is a large grey machine on the benchtop next to a black computer. Open the gel doc tray and wipe it clean using MilliQ water and KimWipes.\n\nA small volume of water (&lt;10ml) is sufficient.\n\nSlide the gel onto the gel doc tray. You can also keep the gel in its plastic tray and put the whole thing on the gel doc.\n\nDo so slowly to avoid creating bubbles under the gel.\nIf you’re unsure if your gel has run long enough, you can leave gel in tray and visualize it. You can then return the gel to the rig and run it for longer if necessary.\n\nClose the tray.\nOpen “Image Lab” application on the OGL laptop connected to the gel doc.\nCheck that the cord labeled “Gel doc” is plugged into the computer.\nSelect New Protocol.\nUnder “Application”, select Nucleic Acid Gels and then GelRed.\n\nThe default setting is to optimize for most intense bands which prevents the gel from being over exposed but may make very faint samples undetectable.\nIf necessary, under “Image Exposure” you can select exposure to optimize for faintest bands or set a manual exposure time.\nIf you are running a gel with samples of highly variable concentrations, it may be useful to run protocols with each optimization option.\n\nSelect “Position Gel” (yellow button on the left side of the window).\n\nThe program will ask you to check that the filter is set to Filter 1.\nCheck that the arm on the upper right side of the gel doc is in the center position labeled Filter 1.\n\nOpen door on the front of the gel doc and position your gel.\n\nYou can zoom in and out under image window on the computer screen.\nYou can enable grid lines by checking the box in the bottom corner of the screen.\n\nClose door and select “Run Protocol” (green button on the left side of the window).\nWait for the gel image to load.\nSave image or change protocol and run again.\nTo save as .jpg image:\n\nSelect File&gt;Export&gt;Export for Publication&gt;Select Export.\nChange file type to .jpg.\nName file and save in appropriate folder. We have a Lotterhos folder on the OGL laptop.\n\n\nAlways clean the gel doc tray after use. You can use MilliQ water from the squirt bottle near the gel doc and a Kimwipe to clean the tray of any remaining gel or TAE. Make sure the tray is dry before you leave.\nDispose of the gel in mayo jar. Be sure to label mayo jar with GelRed and Bromophenol blue.\nRinse gel tray and let dry on drying rack above the sink in the gel room.\nInterpret your gel.\n\n\nFirst, ensure your ladder ran cleanly. You want to see relatively straight and separated lines. Some will have higher feedback when imaging.\nUse the ladder to determine the size in basepairs of your DNA samples.\n\nThermo Fisher GeneRuler 1 kb Ladder, 250-10,000 kbp (ladder we have in the lab)\n\n\nAs shown in the image above, the ladder has 14 distinct bands representing strands of 250 bp at the lowest band to 10,000 bp at the topmost band. What matters most for genomic DNA to be sent for sequencing is ensuring your DNA strands are long enough (&gt; 3,000 bp) to indicate a successful extraction.\n\nExample Gel\n\n2% agarose gel with ladders in the rightmost and leftmost wells, a blank in the second well from the right, and three oyster genomic DNA samples in the remaining wells. This is using a different ladder than the one we have.\n\nBoth ladders ran nicely. The bands are mostly spaced out with minimal streaking.\n\nNote the clustered bands in the ladders for 3,000-20,000 bp\n\nThe second well, a blank, contains nothing beyond loading dye.

    "text": "You can make either a 1% or 2% agarose gel. We have been using 2% gels because they tend to give better/clearer results.\nMaterials\n\nAgarose (chemical shelf)\n1X TAE (reagent shelf)\nScoop (near sink)\nErlenmeyer flask (glassware cabinet)\nStir bar (drawer under stir plate)\nGel rig and combs (gel room)\nWeigh boat\nParafilm\n1kb Plus ladder (-20 freezer)\nTriTrack loading dye (-20 freezer)\nDI water\nMilliQ water (OGL)\nP2.5 and P10 pipettes\nInsulated box with ice\n\nEquipment\n\nMagnetic stir plate (left of the -80 fridge)\nMicrowave (gel room)\nPower supply- PowerEase™ Touch 120W Power Supply (115 VAC) or Hoefer PS300-B (in gel room)\n\nPowerEase™ Touch 120W Power Supply (115 VAC) User Manual\n\nGel Doc for imaging (in OGL)\n\n\n\n\nEnsure you have correctly diluted 1X TAE Buffer. To make 1X from 50X TAE, pour 20mL 10X TAE in the large plastic graduated cyliner. Add 980mL MilliQ water until the mixture reaches the 1000mL mark. Pour and store in a 1L labelled glass bottle.\nMix the gel components.\n\nFor a 1% agarose gel:\n\nSmall gel: 0.60g agarose + 60 mL 1X TAE Buffer\nMedium gel: 1 g agarose + 100 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nFor a 2% agarose gel (what we usually use):\n\nSmall gel: 1.2g agarose + 60 mL 1X TAE Buffer\nMedium gel: 2g agarose + 100 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nWeigh agarose using a plastic small weigh boat. Pour into Erlenmeyer flask. Measure 1X TAE using an 100mL graduated cyliner. Pour into Erlenmeyer flask and swirl gently.\nUse the magnetic stirring plate (put a stir bar inside the Erlenmeyer flask) to mix. Turn the RPM into the 500s until all the clumps are gone. Remove the stir bar using the magnetic pull from another stir bar. Sterilize before putting back.\n\nMelt the gel.\n\nMicrowave the flask with agarose mixture for ~30 seconds.\n\nAlways watch for boiling. If mixture begins to bubble, remove it immediately and carefully swirl until bubbles are gone.\n\nWith hot mitt, remove the flask from microwave and gently swirl.\n\nBe careful—it will be hot! Hold the flask away from you and gently swirl to avoid splashing.\n\nReturn the flask to microwave and continue heating for another 30-40 seconds until mixture is clear and there are no agarose particles.\n\nAllow to cool.\n\nGently swirl while cooling. The solution should be cool enough to hold in the palm of your hand. This can take a couple minutes, please be patient.\n\nAdd GelRed:\n\nSmall gel: 6ul.\nMedium gel: 10 uL\n\nGelRed can be found in the drawer labeled “Gatins GelRed” in the shared wet lab/gel room.\n\nGently swirl until the stain is dissolved (you should not be able to see any red stain in the gel).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelRed Info\n\n\n\nGelRed is light sentsitive, dont keep it out for long! It tends to form a bubble on top. Pop it with a seperate pipette tip before pipetting to ensure it doesn’t get all over the pipette.\n\n\n\nPour the gel.\n\nPlace gel tray in empty gel rig (dry, no TAE). Flip its orientation so it in confined (SEE IMAGE BELOW). Wet the red rubber gaskets of tray before placing in rig so it will be easier to take out later.\n\n\n\nb. Pour gel slowly to avoid bubbles. \n   i. If bubbles form, you can pop them using a pipette tip. \n   ii. Make sure gel is poured evenly. \nc. Add casting combs into the slots. \n   i. Allow enough room between combs for DNA to run down.\n   ii. There are 2 pairs of combs for each size gel; one will create wider wells than the other. You can use either set of combs. \nd. Rinse out the flask and hang on drying rack in Gatins lab.\n\nLet the gel set for ~40 minutes.\n\nThe gel should be solid, cool to the touch, and opaque.\nOnce gel is set, remove the combs.\n\nRemove combs slowly, pulling straight up. It might be easier to do this if the gel is in the buffer.\n\n\nMake sure that the power source is off, and the gel rig is unplugged from the power source before removing the top.\nPlace the tray with your gel in the gel rig with wells on the side with the black plug\n\nSamples will run from the black side toward red side.\nDNA “runs to red” \n\nFill rig with enough 1X TAE Buffer to just cover the entire gel.\n\nThe rig doesn’t need to be filled all the way to the line, just enough to cover the gel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading DNA into gel wells\n\n\n\nRight before taking your 3ul of DNA, make sure to vortex the sample to ensure DNA is evenly dispersed throughout the tube. Forgetting to vortex can result in gels where no band is visible, or super streaky, as DNA may be stuck on the bottom of the sample well rather than suspended in the buffer.\n\n\n\nCreate ladder and DNA dye/sample solutions to load.\n\nThaw DNA, ladder, and TriTrack loading dye. Keep on ice once thawed.\nCut a piece of parafilm and tape to blue tray, waxy side up. Label where samples will go.\nCreate ladder following table below. Vortex and centrifuge ladder before using.\n\n\n\n\nLadder\nLoading Dye\nDI H2O\n\n\n\n\n1 uL\n1 uL\n4 uL\n\n\n\nMakes enough for 2 ladders\nPipette the 1ul ladder, 1ul TriTrack loading dye, and 4ul DI H20 per 2 ladders onto parafilm.\nPipette up and down to mix.\n\nCreate DNA dye/sample solutions following table below.\n\n\n\n\nDNA\nLoading Dye\n\n\n\n\n3 uL\n1 uL\n\n\n\nPipette the 1uL loading dye onto parafilm for each sample.\nUsing filtered tips pipette DNA up and down when pipetting out. Pipette the 3 uL DNA onto parafilm.\nPipette DNA and loading dye up and down on parafilm to mix. \n\n\nLoad Gel\n\nPipette 3 ul of the dye/sample solution into the proper well of the gel.\nRepeat for each sample. Change your pipette tip for each sample.\nKeep track of which samples are where!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPipetting into gel wells\n\n\n\nWhen pipetting into gel wells, be careful not to break the agarose or stick the pipette tip too far into the well so that the sample ejects into the agarose. Position your pipette tip just inside the well and check for dye in the correct well after you pipette it. Check to see if the agarose around the well breaks. Take a note if the agarose breaks around a well.\n\n\n\nRun the gel.\n\nPut the gel box cover into place.\n\nMake sure the wires are plugged in correctly (wire colors match plug colors).\nTurn on the power supply and set timer. For a 1% gel, set it for 130V for 30 minutes. For a 2% gel, we found that 90V for 35 minutes works better.\n\nCheck for bubbles rising at cathode (black plug) side to ensure the rig is working. If you do not see bubbles rising, the gel is not running.\nWhen the gel is done running, turn the off power.\n\nNever open the rig when the power is on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Power Supply Safety Notes\n\n\n\n\nThe power supply can output 300 V at maximum. Never run a protocol that maxes out the voltage.\nYou can safely run up to 4 small gels or 2 medium gels at most simultaneously on the power supply. Do not run more gels than the machine can handle, or it may break the machine.\nNever connect/disconnect cords from the power supply’s power jacks while the blue indicator light is on or when the screen says “Running.”\nMake sure area around the power supply is dry and clean\nWait 5 seconds after ending a run before handling the cords/output leads/gel rig.\nFor proper ventilation, leave at least 10 cm of space behind the instrument, and at least 5 cm of space on each side.\nInformation based on Appendix D of the safety manual\n\n\n\n\nVisualize the gel.\n\nTurn the power supply off.\nRemove the cover from the gel box.\nCarefully remove the tray and gel.\n\nTry to drip excess buffer back into the rig, scraping the bottom of the tray on the edge of the box.\n\nThe gel doc (for visualizing the gel) is in OGL, in the room you walk through right before the autoclave room. The gel doc is a large grey machine on the benchtop next to a black computer. Open the gel doc tray and wipe it clean using MilliQ water and KimWipes.\n\nA small volume of water (&lt;10ml) is sufficient.\n\nSlide the gel onto the gel doc tray. You can also keep the gel in its plastic tray and put the whole thing on the gel doc.\n\nDo so slowly to avoid creating bubbles under the gel.\nIf you’re unsure if your gel has run long enough, you can leave gel in tray and visualize it. You can then return the gel to the rig and run it for longer if necessary.\n\nClose the tray.\nOpen “Image Lab” application on the OGL laptop connected to the gel doc.\nCheck that the cord labeled “Gel doc” is plugged into the computer.\nSelect New Protocol.\nUnder “Application”, select Nucleic Acid Gels and then GelRed.\n\nThe default setting is to optimize for most intense bands which prevents the gel from being over exposed but may make very faint samples undetectable.\nIf necessary, under “Image Exposure” you can select exposure to optimize for faintest bands or set a manual exposure time.\nIf you are running a gel with samples of highly variable concentrations, it may be useful to run protocols with each optimization option.\n\nSelect “Position Gel” (yellow button on the left side of the window).\n\nThe program will ask you to check that the filter is set to Filter 1.\nCheck that the arm on the upper right side of the gel doc is in the center position labeled Filter 1.\n\nOpen door on the front of the gel doc and position your gel.\n\nYou can zoom in and out under image window on the computer screen.\nYou can enable grid lines by checking the box in the bottom corner of the screen.\n\nClose door and select “Run Protocol” (green button on the left side of the window).\nWait for the gel image to load.\nSave image or change protocol and run again.\nTo save as .jpg image:\n\nSelect File&gt;Export&gt;Export for Publication&gt;Select Export.\nChange file type to .jpg.\nName file and save in appropriate folder. We have a Lotterhos folder on the OGL laptop.\n\n\nAlways clean the gel doc tray after use. You can use MilliQ water from the squirt bottle near the gel doc and a Kimwipe to clean the tray of any remaining gel or TAE. Make sure the tray is dry before you leave.\nDispose of the gel in mayo jar. Be sure to label mayo jar with GelRed and Bromophenol blue.\nRinse gel tray and let dry on drying rack above the sink in the gel room.\nInterpret your gel.\n\n\nFirst, ensure your ladder ran cleanly. You want to see relatively straight and separated lines. Some will have higher feedback when imaging.\nUse the ladder to determine the size in basepairs of your DNA samples.\n\nThermo Fisher GeneRuler 1 kb Ladder, 250-10,000 kbp (ladder we have in the lab)\n\n\nAs shown in the image above, the ladder has 14 distinct bands representing strands of 250 bp at the lowest band to 10,000 bp at the topmost band. What matters most for genomic DNA to be sent for sequencing is ensuring your DNA strands are long enough (&gt; 3,000 bp) to indicate a successful extraction.\n\nExample Gel\n\n2% agarose gel with ladders in the rightmost and leftmost wells, a blank in the second well from the right, and three oyster genomic DNA samples in the remaining wells. This is using a different ladder than the one we have.\n\nBoth ladders ran nicely. The bands are mostly spaced out with minimal streaking.\n\nNote the clustered bands in the ladders for 3,000-20,000 bp\n\nThe second well, a blank, contains nothing beyond loading dye. As there was no sample running there, the image shows no DNA present, which is as it should be.\nSamples 1 and 2 ran properly- each has a clear distinct line placing them between 3,000-20,000 bp in length (appropriate for genomic DNA). These samples appear to be in a good state for sequencing.\nSample 3, on the other hand, is streaky, indicating that the DNA likely degraded during the electrophoresis process. There is one bright band up near the top in the 3,000-20,000 bp range, which is good, but this sample probably isn’t in the best shape for sequencing.",

    "text": "Edit this page\nProtocols for understanding different types of ethanol and when to use them.\nProtocol taken and adapted from Lotterhos Lab\n\nNote: this protocols page may be outdated.\n\n\nThe main difference is that denatured ethanol contains additives that make it unsafe to drink. On the other hand, non-denatured ethanol is ethanol with no additives or denaturants.\nDenatured ethanol is a form of ethanol containing a high amount of additives and denaturants that makes it poisonous. Denatured ethanol has bad taste and foul smell that makes it unsafe for drinking. There are two forms of non-denatured ethanol named 95% ethanol and absolute ethanol. These forms are known as “pure” forms of ethanol.\n\n\n\nHistological/reagent ethanol is denatured ethanol. Molecular grade ethanol is non-denatured. Source\n\n\n\nThis article has the following information on ethanol for tissue preservation:\n\nIf possible, the use of non-denaturated ethanol is favoured, but traces of denaturating agents (e.g. isopropanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, also gasoline) usually do not significantly alter the performance.\nAccording to plenty of tests, the optimal concentration is about 95–99% (King and Porter 2004, who also compared with isopropanol).\nWith 70% ethanol, a high degree of degradation has been observed, even after one year.\nInterestingly, absolute ethanol may not be the optimal medium as it is most expensive and can contain traces of benzene that seriously affect DNA preservation (Ito 1992).\n\nSide note: KEL tried to find Ito 1992, but the orginal print is not available online.\n\nThe ethanol-tissue ratio should exceed 5:1, although some authors recommend much higher ratios (e.g. Martin 1977).\nWhen ordering, look for “pure ethanol” and check the SDS to make sure it does not contain additives\n95.6% ethanol is an azeotrope, which means the vapor state has the same ethanol-to-water ratio as the liquid state. This means as it evaporates the remaining liquid will still be at 95.6%\nWhen adding wet tissues to 95% ethanol, it can decrease the concentration of ethanol. It can be helpful to change the ethanol after the first few months.\nMore information on other ways to preserve tissues are found in this article\n\nORDERING INFORMATION:Ethyl alcohol, Pure 190 proof, meets USP testing specifications, non-denatured ethanol 493538-4L\nEthanol, 190 proof, 95%, Reagent ACS, Spectrophotometric Grade, Thermo Scientific Chemicals AC615110040\nUSP vs. ACS ethanol: ACS reagent grade ethyl alcohol meets or exceeds the specifications the American Chemical Society’s Reagent Handbook. USP Grade are chemicals manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and which meet the requirements of the US Pharmacopeia. ACS and USP are generally equivalent.\n\n\n\nInformation from this article explains the use of ethanol for cleaning. The main points are summarized here:\n\nAlthough it may seem counter-intuitive, 70% ethanol seems to be the most effective concentration, as 90% ethanol coagulates the protein, and the protein layer that is created effectively renders the cell dormant. At a 70% concentration, however, the ethanol takes longer to evaporate and this longer contact time means that it is able to penetrate cells more effectively. The water in a 70% grade is also important in denaturing proteins. And 70% ethanol also tends to be cheaper and is less flammable.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, diluted ethanol is no longer an azeotrope. At 70%, ethanol will evaporate faster than water, so evaporative loss will result in a gradual decrease in ethanol concentration in the remaining solution. Don’t be surprised when an unsealed beaker of 70% ethanol ‘stops working’. So don’t make more than is necessary at a time, and make sure to label the date when it was made (which you should do for everything you make anyway).\nSecond, ethanol/water mixtures don’t have additive volumes. That means that if you want to make 1 liter of 70% ethanol from absolute ethanol, you can’t do it by mixing 700 ml of ethanol and 300 ml of water. The correct method is to measure 700 ml of ethanol and then bring it to a volume of 1 liter with water.\n\nWhy? When you mix water and ethanol, the ethanol molecules occupy the space between the water molecules. A helpful way to visualize this is to think about sand and rocks – if you were to mix 1 liter of each, the final volume would be less than 2 liters because the sand would fall between the rocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething about the process of making ethanol makes it hard to get from 95% to 100%. Sometimes this contains additives to get it up to 100%, but they are not denaturing agents.\nSome procedures that are sensitive to the presence of water require absolute ethanol.\nA common method to produce ethanol with a higher concentration than 95% is to use additives that disrupt the azeotrope composition and allow further distillation. For this reason, absolute ethanol sometimes contains trace amounts of these additives (such as benzene). source\n\nORDERING INFORMATION Ethyl alcohol, Pure 200 proof, for molecular biology E7023-4L",
