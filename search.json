The primer mix is suitable for the amplification of all Illumina libraries flanked by the P5 and P7 flow cell sequences. Primers are supplied at a 10X concentration of 20 μM each, and have been formulated as described below. User-supplied primer mixes may be used in combination with incomplete or custom adapters. Please contact Technical Support at sequencing.roche.com/support for guidelines on the formulation of user-supplied library amplification primers.\n• To achieve the highest amplification efficiency and avoid primer depletion, it is critical to use an optimal concentration of high-quality primers. Primers should be used at a final concentration of 0.5 – 4 μM each. For libraries constructed from ≥100 ng input DNA, a final concentration of at least 2 μM of each primer is recommended.\n• Library amplification primers should be HPLC-purified and modified to include a phosphorothioate bond at the 3’-terminal of each primer (to prevent degradation by the strong proofreading activity of KAPA HiFi HotStart). Always store and dilute primers in a buffered solution (e.g., 10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0–8.5), and limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles. To achieve the latter, store primers at 2°C to 8°C for short-term use, or as single-use aliquots at -15°C to -25°C.\n\n5.1 Assemble each library amplification reaction as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nVolume\n1/3 Volume\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nKAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (2X)\n25 µL\n8.3 µL\n\n\n\nLibrary Amplification Primer Mix (10X)*\n5 µL\n1.7 µL\nif using custon Primers i5/i7 they should be at [20µM]\n\n\nAdapter-ligated library\n20 µL\n6.7 µL\n\n\n\n——————–\n——\n——\n——\n\n\nTotal Volume\n50 µL\n16.7 µL\n\n\n\n\n** NOTE: keep Adapter ligated library extra just in case **\n\n5.2 Mix thoroughly and centrifuge briefly.\n5.3 Amplify using the following cycling protocol:\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTemp\nTime\nCycles\n\n\n\n\nInitial Denaturation\n98°C\n45 sec\n1\n\n\nDenaturation\n98°C\n15 sec\n\n\n\nAnnealing\n60°C\n30 sec\n8X\n\n\nExtension\n72°C\n30 sec\n\n\n\nFinal Extension\n72°C\n1 min\n1\n\n\nHOLD\n4°C\n∞\n1\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Proceed directly to Post-amplification Cleanup (step 6).\n\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT- Only do this the first time and check your library.

    "text": "The KAPA Library Amplification Primer Mix (10X) is designed to eliminate or delay primer depletion during library amplification reactions performed with KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix. The primer mix is suitable for the amplification of all Illumina libraries flanked by the P5 and P7 flow cell sequences. Primers are supplied at a 10X concentration of 20 μM each, and have been formulated as described below. User-supplied primer mixes may be used in combination with incomplete or custom adapters. Please contact Technical Support at sequencing.roche.com/support for guidelines on the formulation of user-supplied library amplification primers.\n• To achieve the highest amplification efficiency and avoid primer depletion, it is critical to use an optimal concentration of high-quality primers. Primers should be used at a final concentration of 0.5 – 4 μM each. For libraries constructed from ≥100 ng input DNA, a final concentration of at least 2 μM of each primer is recommended.\n• Library amplification primers should be HPLC-purified and modified to include a phosphorothioate bond at the 3’-terminal of each primer (to prevent degradation by the strong proofreading activity of KAPA HiFi HotStart). Always store and dilute primers in a buffered solution (e.g., 10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0–8.5), and limit the number of freeze-thaw cycles. To achieve the latter, store primers at 2°C to 8°C for short-term use, or as single-use aliquots at -15°C to -25°C.\n\n5.1 Assemble each library amplification reaction as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nVolume\n1/3 Volume\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nKAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (2X)\n25 µL\n8.3 µL\n\n\n\nLibrary Amplification Primer Mix (10X)*\n5 µL\n1.7 µL\nif using custon Primers i5/i7 they should be at [20µM]\n\n\nAdapter-ligated library\n20 µL\n6.7 µL\n\n\n\n——————–\n——\n——\n——\n\n\nTotal Volume\n50 µL\n16.7 µL\n\n\n\n\n** NOTE: keep Adapter ligated library extra just in case **\n\n5.2 Mix thoroughly and centrifuge briefly.\n5.3 Amplify using the following cycling protocol:\n\n\n\n\nStep\nTemp\nTime\nCycles\n\n\n\n\nInitial Denaturation\n98°C\n45 sec\n1\n\n\nDenaturation\n98°C\n15 sec\n\n\n\nAnnealing\n60°C\n30 sec\n8X\n\n\nExtension\n72°C\n30 sec\n\n\n\nFinal Extension\n72°C\n1 min\n1\n\n\nHOLD\n4°C\n∞\n1\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Proceed directly to Post-amplification Cleanup (step 6).",

    "text": "Edit this page\nProtocols for understanding different types of ethanol and when to use them.\nProtocol taken and adapted from Lotterhos Lab\n\nNote: this protocols page may be outdated.\n\n\nThe main difference is that denatured ethanol contains additives that make it unsafe to drink. On the other hand, non-denatured ethanol is ethanol with no additives or denaturants.\nDenatured ethanol is a form of ethanol containing a high amount of additives and denaturants that makes it poisonous. Denatured ethanol has bad taste and foul smell that makes it unsafe for drinking. There are two forms of non-denatured ethanol named 95% ethanol and absolute ethanol. These forms are known as “pure” forms of ethanol.\n\n\n\nHistological/reagent ethanol is denatured ethanol. Molecular grade ethanol is non-denatured. Source\n\n\n\nThis article has the following information on ethanol for tissue preservation:\n\nIf possible, the use of non-denaturated ethanol is favoured, but traces of denaturating agents (e.g. isopropanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, also gasoline) usually do not significantly alter the performance.\nAccording to plenty of tests, the optimal concentration is about 95–99% (King and Porter 2004, who also compared with isopropanol).\nWith 70% ethanol, a high degree of degradation has been observed, even after one year.\nInterestingly, absolute ethanol may not be the optimal medium as it is most expensive and can contain traces of benzene that seriously affect DNA preservation (Ito 1992).\n\nSide note: KEL tried to find Ito 1992, but the orginal print is not available online.\n\nThe ethanol-tissue ratio should exceed 5:1, although some authors recommend much higher ratios (e.g. Martin 1977).\nWhen ordering, look for “pure ethanol” and check the SDS to make sure it does not contain additives\n95.6% ethanol is an azeotrope, which means the vapor state has the same ethanol-to-water ratio as the liquid state. This means as it evaporates the remaining liquid will still be at 95.6%\nWhen adding wet tissues to 95% ethanol, it can decrease the concentration of ethanol. It can be helpful to change the ethanol after the first few months.\nMore information on other ways to preserve tissues are found in this article\n\nORDERING INFORMATION:Ethyl alcohol, Pure 190 proof, meets USP testing specifications, non-denatured ethanol 493538-4L\nEthanol, 190 proof, 95%, Reagent ACS, Spectrophotometric Grade, Thermo Scientific Chemicals AC615110040\nUSP vs. ACS ethanol: ACS reagent grade ethyl alcohol meets or exceeds the specifications the American Chemical Society’s Reagent Handbook. USP Grade are chemicals manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and which meet the requirements of the US Pharmacopeia. ACS and USP are generally equivalent.\n\n\n\nInformation from this article explains the use of ethanol for cleaning. The main points are summarized here:\n\nAlthough it may seem counter-intuitive, 70% ethanol seems to be the most effective concentration, as 90% ethanol coagulates the protein, and the protein layer that is created effectively renders the cell dormant. At a 70% concentration, however, the ethanol takes longer to evaporate and this longer contact time means that it is able to penetrate cells more effectively. The water in a 70% grade is also important in denaturing proteins. And 70% ethanol also tends to be cheaper and is less flammable.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, diluted ethanol is no longer an azeotrope. At 70%, ethanol will evaporate faster than water, so evaporative loss will result in a gradual decrease in ethanol concentration in the remaining solution. Don’t be surprised when an unsealed beaker of 70% ethanol ‘stops working’. So don’t make more than is necessary at a time, and make sure to label the date when it was made (which you should do for everything you make anyway).\nSecond, ethanol/water mixtures don’t have additive volumes. That means that if you want to make 1 liter of 70% ethanol from absolute ethanol, you can’t do it by mixing 700 ml of ethanol and 300 ml of water. The correct method is to measure 700 ml of ethanol and then bring it to a volume of 1 liter with water.\n\nWhy? When you mix water and ethanol, the ethanol molecules occupy the space between the water molecules. A helpful way to visualize this is to think about sand and rocks – if you were to mix 1 liter of each, the final volume would be less than 2 liters because the sand would fall between the rocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething about the process of making ethanol makes it hard to get from 95% to 100%. Sometimes this contains additives to get it up to 100%, but they are not denaturing agents.\nSome procedures that are sensitive to the presence of water require absolute ethanol.\nA common method to produce ethanol with a higher concentration than 95% is to use additives that disrupt the azeotrope composition and allow further distillation. For this reason, absolute ethanol sometimes contains trace amounts of these additives (such as benzene). source\n\nORDERING INFORMATION Ethyl alcohol, Pure 200 proof, for molecular biology E7023-4L",

To make 1X from 50X TAE, pour 20mL 10X TAE in the large plastic graduated cyliner. Add 980mL MilliQ water until the mixture reaches the 1000mL mark. Pour and store in a 1L labelled glass bottle.\nMix the gel components.\n\nFor a 1% agarose gel:\n\nSmall gel: 0.60g agarose + 60 mL 1X TAE Buffer\nMedium gel: 1 g agarose + 100 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nFor a 2% agarose gel (what we usually use):\n\nSmall gel: 1.2g agarose + 60 mL 1X TAE Buffer\nMedium gel: 2g agarose + 100 mL 1X TAE Buffer\n\nWeigh agarose using a plastic small weigh boat. Pour into Erlenmeyer flask. Measure 1X TAE using an 100mL graduated cyliner. Pour into Erlenmeyer flask and swirl gently.\nUse the magnetic stirring plate (put a stir bar inside the Erlenmeyer flask) to mix. Turn the RPM into the 500s until all the clumps are gone. Remove the stir bar using the magnetic pull from another stir bar. Sterilize before putting back.\n\nMelt the gel.\n\nMicrowave the flask with agarose mixture for ~30 seconds.\n\nAlways watch for boiling. If mixture begins to bubble, remove it immediately and carefully swirl until bubbles are gone.\n\nWith hot mitt, remove the flask from microwave and gently swirl.\n\nBe careful—it will be hot! Hold the flask away from you and gently swirl to avoid splashing.\n\nReturn the flask to microwave and continue heating for another 30-40 seconds until mixture is clear and there are no agarose particles.\n\nAllow to cool.\n\nGently swirl while cooling. The solution should be cool enough to hold in the palm of your hand. This can take a couple minutes, please be patient.\n\nAdd GelRed:\n\nSmall gel: 6ul.\nMedium gel: 10 uL\n\nGelRed can be found in the drawer labeled “Gatins GelRed” in the shared wet lab/gel room.\n\nGently swirl until the stain is dissolved (you should not be able to see any red stain in the gel).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelRed Info\n\n\n\nGelRed is light sentsitive, dont keep it out for long! It tends to form a bubble on top. Pop it with a seperate pipette tip before pipetting to ensure it doesn’t get all over the pipette.\n\n\n\nPour the gel.\n\nPlace gel tray in empty gel rig (dry, no TAE).

Never run a protocol that maxes out the voltage.\nYou can safely run up to 4 small gels or 2 medium gels at most simultaneously on the power supply. Do not run more gels than the machine can handle, or it may break the machine.\nNever connect/disconnect cords from the power supply’s power jacks while the blue indicator light is on or when the screen says “Running.”\nMake sure area around the power supply is dry and clean\nWait 5 seconds after ending a run before handling the cords/output leads/gel rig.\nFor proper ventilation, leave at least 10 cm of space behind the instrument, and at least 5 cm of space on each side.\nInformation based on Appendix D of the safety manual\n\n\n\n\nVisualize the gel.\n\nTurn the power supply off.\nRemove the cover from the gel box.\nCarefully remove the tray and gel.\n\nTry to drip excess buffer back into the rig, scraping the bottom of the tray on the edge of the box.\n\nThe gel doc (for visualizing the gel) is in OGL, in the room you walk through right before the autoclave room.

Open the gel doc tray and wipe it clean using MilliQ water and KimWipes.\n\nA small volume of water (&lt;10ml) is sufficient.\n\nSlide the gel onto the gel doc tray. You can also keep the gel in its plastic tray and put the whole thing on the gel doc.\n\nDo so slowly to avoid creating bubbles under the gel.\nIf you’re unsure if your gel has run long enough, you can leave gel in tray and visualize it.

Be sure to label mayo jar with GelRed and Bromophenol blue.\nRinse gel tray and let dry on drying rack above the sink in the gel room.\nInterpret your gel.\n\n\nFirst, ensure your ladder ran cleanly. You want to see relatively straight and separated lines. Some will have higher feedback when imaging.\nUse the ladder to determine the size in basepairs of your DNA samples.\n\nThermo Fisher GeneRuler 1 kb Ladder, 250-10,000 kbp (ladder we have in the lab)\n\n\nAs shown in the image above, the ladder has 14 distinct bands representing strands of 250 bp at the lowest band to 10,000 bp at the topmost band. What matters most for genomic DNA to be sent for sequencing is ensuring your DNA strands are long enough (&gt; 3,000 bp) to indicate a successful extraction.\n\nExample Gel\n\n2% agarose gel with ladders in the rightmost and leftmost wells, a blank in the second well from the right, and three oyster genomic DNA samples in the remaining wells. This is using a different ladder than the one we have.\n\nBoth ladders ran nicely. The bands are mostly spaced out with minimal streaking.\n\nNote the clustered bands in the ladders for 3,000-20,000 bp\n\nThe second well, a blank, contains nothing beyond loading dye. As there was no sample running there, the image shows no DNA present, which is as it should be.\nSamples 1 and 2 ran properly- each has a clear distinct line placing them between 3,000-20,000 bp in length (appropriate for genomic DNA). These samples appear to be in a good state for sequencing.\nSample 3, on the other hand, is streaky, indicating that the DNA likely degraded during the electrophoresis process. There is one bright band up near the top in the 3,000-20,000 bp range, which is good, but this sample probably isn’t in the best shape for sequencing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if I make the wrong percent agarose gel?\n\n\n\n\nWhen removing the combs from a set gel, remove very gently and pull them straight up and out to keep pieces of gel from getting loosened and knocked into the well.\nMake sure not to touch the sides of the wells with the pipette tip when adding samples in.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe voltage machine may give an “E1” error and will not begin running. When this happens, check that there is enough TAE buffer in the rig such that the ends of the electrodes are submerged. Add more 1X TAE if not.\nAlso check that electrodes are tightened on each side. The red one on rig 2 tends to get a bit loose.\n\n\n\n\n\nYour sample may have degraded. Be careful not to leave DNA samples in the fridge for more than 4 or 5 days and try not to thaw and refreeze samples too many times.",

Therefore, it is best to use filtered tips when working with different samples to prevent cross contamination from any sample that has gotten into the pipette (ex. when pipetting different DNA samples for a DNA extraction)\nUnfiltered tips are appropriate to use when pipetting solutions, dyes, and buffers, i.e. things less likely to cause significant contamination to other pipetted materials. (Ex. loading dye, gel ladders, extraction buffers, etc.)\nSpray a kimwipe with ethanol and wipe down pipettes before and after use to remove any potential remaining sample.\n\n\n\n\nDrawing up liquid. Check the amount on the pipette is correct. When pipetting, be sure only to push down on the plunger to the first stop and slowly release to pick up the liquid until your thumb comes completely off the plunger. If you go past the first stop, you will draw up more liquid than the amount you set on the pipette and/or create bubbles. If you push down and then release quickly to draw up liquid, it can cause aspiration and contaminate the pipette if you aren’t using filtered tips. If you are using filtered tips, aspiration can cause liquid to land on the filter, so the pipette tip will hold less liquid than you specified. When drawing up liquid, you may choose to pipette up and down 3 times to pre-wet the pipette tip. Ensure to only go to the first stop for each of the 3 times.\nCheck the pipette tip has the correct amount. Look at the pipette tip, or all the pipette tips if using the multichannel. Does it have the amount of liquid that you expect? Are there air bubbles (other than a tiny bubble that often forms at the very apex of the tip)? If so, push out the liquid and restart.\nPushing out liquid. Slowly push down on the plunger past the first stop until you reach the final stopping point for the plunger. Keep your thumb on the plunger until the tip of the pipette is completely removed from the solution. Drawing up your thumb before the tip is removed will suck up some of the solution.\nCheck the pipette tip is empty. After you push the liquid out, check the pipette tip again and make sure it is empty. Dispose of the tip in a EHS-labeled waste jar. If there is any liquid in the tip that didn’t get pushed out or beads of liquid on the inside of the tip, proceed to the next step.\nSolution is stuck in the pipette tip. If there is any liquid in the tip that didn’t get pushed out, carefully take the tip off. When you put the tip back on the pipette, some of the liquid may get pushed out, so carefully put the tip back on over the well where the solution needs to go. Then push down to the second stop and push the rest of the liquid out.",

(Ex. loading dye, gel ladders, extraction buffers, etc.)\nSpray a kimwipe with ethanol and wipe down pipettes before and after use to remove any potential remaining sample.",

    "text": "Drawing up liquid. Check the amount on the pipette is correct. When pipetting, be sure only to push down on the plunger to the first stop and slowly release to pick up the liquid until your thumb comes completely off the plunger. If you go past the first stop, you will draw up more liquid than the amount you set on the pipette and/or create bubbles. If you push down and then release quickly to draw up liquid, it can cause aspiration and contaminate the pipette if you aren’t using filtered tips. If you are using filtered tips, aspiration can cause liquid to land on the filter, so the pipette tip will hold less liquid than you specified. When drawing up liquid, you may choose to pipette up and down 3 times to pre-wet the pipette tip. Ensure to only go to the first stop for each of the 3 times.\nCheck the pipette tip has the correct amount. Look at the pipette tip, or all the pipette tips if using the multichannel. Does it have the amount of liquid that you expect? Are there air bubbles (other than a tiny bubble that often forms at the very apex of the tip)? If so, push out the liquid and restart.\nPushing out liquid. Slowly push down on the plunger past the first stop until you reach the final stopping point for the plunger. Keep your thumb on the plunger until the tip of the pipette is completely removed from the solution. Drawing up your thumb before the tip is removed will suck up some of the solution.\nCheck the pipette tip is empty. After you push the liquid out, check the pipette tip again and make sure it is empty. Dispose of the tip in a EHS-labeled waste jar. If there is any liquid in the tip that didn’t get pushed out or beads of liquid on the inside of the tip, proceed to the next step.\nSolution is stuck in the pipette tip. If there is any liquid in the tip that didn’t get pushed out, carefully take the tip off. When you put the tip back on the pipette, some of the liquid may get pushed out, so carefully put the tip back on over the well where the solution needs to go. Then push down to the second stop and push the rest of the liquid out.",

The microbalance we use does not tare as fast as the Lotterhos Lab scale; be patient. Also recommended to stay still and keep your hands off the counter while it tares.\n\n\n\nTransfer the sample from the micro-centrifuge\n\n\n\nUsing a small metal spatula, transfer 0.8 - 1.2 mg (range specified by BU, see note below) of ground animal tissue from the micro-centrifuge tube into the tin capsule and record weight on data sheet.\nWhat we did is we used a small plastic weighing dish to put all the powder into (can just flip vial upside down over it), then scooped powder from there into the capsule. During this step, I found it easiest to use two spatulas and kind of bunch together some of the powder in the corner of a spatula, so that when you hold it over the capsule and tilt it, the powder on it will fall at once into the opening. With this method, it usually took 1-3 of these small scoops to get to the 0.8 - 1.2 mg range. Close the scale door and check weight between each scoop (again, keep your hands off the counter while the scale adjusts).\nRinse the spatula with deionized water and 70% ethanol and dry with a kim wipe between each tissue sample.\n\n\nCarefully “crush” the tin capsule into a small square by gently applying force using two pairs of forceps\n\n\nEnsure that no material will leak from the capsule after it has been crushed, as the loss of material can affect both the isotope and elemental data through incorrect mass determination and subsequent sample-to-sample contamination.\nWhen folding capsules, please make sure that you first fold over the top to seal the material.\nThen fold and compress the capsule into a small cube. Don’t flatten boat and avoid any sharp points that will snag in autosampler.\n(This step is easiest with curved forceps.)\nAfter crushing the tin capsule, I usually tested for leaks by shaking it a bit over the black counter and watching to see if any specks appeared. If it leaks, just redo the process with a new capsule.\n\nTutorial on how to fold the tin capsules:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfF6yuiKWrA\n\nOnce weighed and crushed, place the sample in the appropriate well of a cell plate, making certain the sample is in the correct well as recorded on the data sheet.\n\n\nWe use 96-well polystyrene cell plates. Each well has an alpha-numeric position (rows A - H, columns 1-12), thus the first well is A1, the next A2, and so on.\nOnce the capsule is in the plate, you can put the rest of the powder away by scooping it back into the vial from the weighing dish and returning the vial to its original position. Then clean the weighing dish and other tools.\n\n\nPut both the cell plates and trays of micro-centrifuge tubes containing remaining tissue back in a closed desiccation chamber until you are ready to send them to be processed.\n\n\n\nLabel the plate with:\n\nPI first/last name\nNortheastern University Marine Science Center\nProject title\nTray n / n\nPI contact into (email and cell)\n\nWhen all samples are ready to be sent out, contact Bob Michener at BU about sending them or bringing them to the BU stable isotope lab\n\nBUSIL-EA-Sample-Submission.xls\nIf you have any questions about the process, you can message Fin or Alice on Slack.",

(in Grabowski lab)\n\n\n\nCheck that samples are dry by weighing a couple of samples on a microbalance (3 digits is fine given sample weights are &lt; 1.1mg) about an hour apart\nClean forceps between samples as above (rinse with DI and wipe with clean kimwipe)\n\n\nGrind each tissue sample with a mortar and pestle\n\n\n\nCLEAN mortar and pestle, forceps and other instruments (including spatulas) between each sample (rinse with DI and 70% ethanol and wipe with clean kimwipe)\nTransfer the sample with a clean spatula\nPut the ground tissue back into its micro-centrifuge tube\nMake sure micro-centrifuge tube caps are secured tightly and store samples on a tube rack (labeled with description and date) in a desiccation chamber until sample is weighed.\n\n\nWeigh the samples to the nearest 0.001mg (using the microbalance in the Gatins lab).\n\n\nPlace a 4x6mm tin capsule on the scale and tare (zero) the scale. The microbalance we use does not tare as fast as the Lotterhos Lab scale; be patient. Also recommended to stay still and keep your hands off the counter while it tares.\n\n\n\nTransfer the sample from the micro-centrifuge\n\n\n\nUsing a small metal spatula, transfer 0.8 - 1.2 mg (range specified by BU, see note below) of ground animal tissue from the micro-centrifuge tube into the tin capsule and record weight on data sheet.\nWhat we did is we used a small plastic weighing dish to put all the powder into (can just flip vial upside down over it), then scooped powder from there into the capsule. During this step, I found it easiest to use two spatulas and kind of bunch together some of the powder in the corner of a spatula, so that when you hold it over the capsule and tilt it, the powder on it will fall at once into the opening. With this method, it usually took 1-3 of these small scoops to get to the 0.8 - 1.2 mg range. Close the scale door and check weight between each scoop (again, keep your hands off the counter while the scale adjusts).\nRinse the spatula with deionized water and 70% ethanol and dry with a kim wipe between each tissue sample.\n\n\nCarefully “crush” the tin capsule into a small square by gently applying force using two pairs of forceps\n\n\nEnsure that no material will leak from the capsule after it has been crushed, as the loss of material can affect both the isotope and elemental data through incorrect mass determination and subsequent sample-to-sample contamination.\nWhen folding capsules, please make sure that you first fold over the top to seal the material.\nThen fold and compress the capsule into a small cube. Don’t flatten boat and avoid any sharp points that will snag in autosampler.\n(This step is easiest with curved forceps.)\nAfter crushing the tin capsule, I usually tested for leaks by shaking it a bit over the black counter and watching to see if any specks appeared. If it leaks, just redo the process with a new capsule.\n\nTutorial on how to fold the tin capsules:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfF6yuiKWrA\n\nOnce weighed and crushed, place the sample in the appropriate well of a cell plate, making certain the sample is in the correct well as recorded on the data sheet.\n\n\nWe use 96-well polystyrene cell plates. Each well has an alpha-numeric position (rows A - H, columns 1-12), thus the first well is A1, the next A2, and so on.\nOnce the capsule is in the plate, you can put the rest of the powder away by scooping it back into the vial from the weighing dish and returning the vial to its original position. Then clean the weighing dish and other tools.\n\n\nPut both the cell plates and trays of micro-centrifuge tubes containing remaining tissue back in a closed desiccation chamber until you are ready to send them to be processed.\n\n\n\nLabel the plate with:\n\nPI first/last name\nNortheastern University Marine Science Center\nProject title\nTray n / n\nPI contact into (email and cell)\n\nWhen all samples are ready to be sent out, contact Bob Michener at BU about sending them or bringing them to the BU stable isotope lab\n\nBUSIL-EA-Sample-Submission.xls\nIf you have any questions about the process, you can message Fin or Alice on Slack.",
