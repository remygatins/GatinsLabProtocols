## Grad School 

### Opportunities & Research Experience

- Make you a more competitive applicant (grad school and jobs!)
- Help you figure out your interests and what you don’t like
- Available at any stage
  - Undergrad (school year, summers)
  - Post-bac
  - Course-based Master’s
- Paid or unpaid
  - There are fewer paid experiences, but they do exist!!!
- Research technicians
  - Jobs available post-graduation working in a lab or in the field
  - Many people work as technicians to gain experience and make money while applying for grad school the next year

### Types of Grad Programs

### Application Process

**Course-based Master’s**

- Similar to undergrad applications
- Apply anywhere from December to April (depends on school)
- Materials
  - CV
  - Personal statement
- Often have small scholarships (merit-based, need-based, DEI)
- Because these are programs where you pay the tuition, they are less competitive than research-based positions

**Research-based Master’s & PhD**

- Often referred to in “application cycles”
- Cycle starts ~September where you look for posted opportunities or cold email PIs
- From ~October to early December, you meet with PIs and lab via Zoom (either casual conversations or more formal interviews)
- Typically, PIs will “invite you to apply” to the graduate school ~mid-November to mid-December
- This means that you’re on a shortlist of applicants that they are considering
- Applications due ~December to January
- Larger schools have recruitment days to tour campus and interview in person
- Final decisions made ~March to April at the latest via email from PI
- Many people apply 1+ cycles before getting accepted!
