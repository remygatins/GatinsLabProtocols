# eDNA Filter Extraction 

**(using Qiagen blood and tissue kit)**

[Edit this Page](https://github.com/remygatins/GatinsLab/blob/main/lab_molec_eDNA_extraction.qmd)

## Filter Lysing:

**Need:**

- [ ] sterile sissors and forcepts
- [ ] 50 ml tube with 10% bleach OR 
- [ ] ethanol lamp with 100% ethanol + 50 ml tube with 70% ethanol & 50 ml tube of MilliQ water
- [ ] DI water spray bottle
- [ ] 2 ml tubes (with tapered not flat bottoms)
- [ ] ice container
- [ ] [Qiagen blood and tissue kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit?catno=69506) (box labeled for eDNA use)
  - [ ] Buffer ATL (if there are precipitates heat at 56 C and mix gently)
  - [ ] Proteinase K

**Steps:**

***BOLDED STEPS** = differs from Qiagen blood and tissue kit protocol

- [ ] 1. preheat thermomixer to 56 °C
- [ ] 2. clean area with 10% bleach, water, then 70% ethanol
- [ ] 3. prep ice container
- [ ] 4. label 2 ml tubes
- [ ] 5. add **360 µl of Buffer ATL** & **40 µl of Proteinase K** into labeled 2 ml tubes
- [ ] 6. clean instruments by soaking in 10% bleach, spraying with DI water (holding over waste container/glassware), then wiping down with kimwipe. (could also sterilize with DI water, 70% ethanol, then then running instrument through an ethanol lamp filled with 100% ethano)
- [ ] 7. carefully remove filter from storage tube with forcepts and unroll until it is just folded in half
- [ ] 8. cut filters into 3 strips

- [ ] 9. place filter strips into 2ml tube with the Buffer ATL & Proteinase K
- [ ] 10. seal tube
- [ ] 11. vortex for 15 sec
- [ ] 12. store on ice until all filters have been cut up and transfered
- [ ] 13. repeat steps 6 through 12 for every filter (changing gloves between each filter)
- [ ] 14. Place samples on thermo-mixer set at 56 °C at 600 rpm (check after 2 mins to make sure everything is sealed)
- [ ] 15. incubate for at least **12–14 hr**

## DNA extraction:

**Need:**

- [ ] 100% molecular grade ethanol
- [ ] [Qiagen blood and tissue kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit?catno=69506) (box labeled for eDNA use)
  - [ ] DNeasy spin columns
  - [ ] DNeasy collection tubes
  - [ ] Buffer AL
  - [ ] Buffer AW1
  - [ ] Buffer AW2
- [ ] 1.5 or 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes (for final storage)
- [ ] warmed 1X low TE buffer (37ºC); may need to make by diluting [20X low TE buffer](https://remygatins.github.io/GatinsLabProtocols/lab_molec_low_te_buffer.html)

**Steps:**

- [ ] 1. prep and clean bench with 10% bleach, water, then 70% ethanol
- [ ] 2. label spin-column tubes
- [ ] 3. remove samples from thermo-mixer
- [ ] 4. add **400 μl Buffer AL** to samples, then vortex
- [ ] 5. add **400 μl Ethanol (100% molecular grade)**, then vortex
- [ ] 6. pipet half of solution to DNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube
- [ ] 7. centrifuge for 1 min at ≥ 6000 x g (8000 rpm)
- [ ] 8. change gloves after each centrifuge step
- [ ] 9. discard the flow-through & collection tube
- [ ] 10. tranfer spin column to a new collection tube
- [ ] 11. pipet the rest of the solution from the initial tubes into the spin column
- [ ] 12. centrifuge for 1 min at ≥ 6000 x g (8000 rpm)
- [ ] 13. discard the flow-through & collection tube
- [ ] 14. tranfer spin column to a new collection tube
- [ ] 15. add 500 μl Buffer AW1
- [ ] 16. centrifuge for 1 min at ≥6000 x g (8000 rpm)
- [ ] 17. discard the flow-through & collection tube
- [ ] 18. tranfer spin column to a new collection tube
- [ ] 19. add 500 μl Buffer AW2
- [ ] 20. centrifuge for 3 min at 20,000 x g (14,000 rpm)
- [ ] 21. discard flow through & spin again for 1 more min
- [ ] 22. make sure spin column membrane are dry after this step; spin again for 1 min if not
- [ ] 23. discard the flow-through & collection tube
- [ ] 24. tranfer spin column to a new 1.5 ml or 2 ml microcentrifuge tube
- [ ] 25. add **50 μl of warm low TE buffer** (warm in thermomixer, 37 C)
- [ ] 26. incubate for 1 min at room temperature (15–25°C)
- [ ] 27. centrifuge for 1 min at ≥6000 x g (8000 rpm)
- [ ] 28. add another **50 μl warm low TE buffer**
- [ ] 29. incubate for 10 min at room temperature (15–25°C)
- [ ] 30. centrifuge for 1 min at ≥6000 x g (8000 rpm)
- [ ] 31. store in fridge for a few days or freeze at -20 or -80 if not using immediately 

## Possible Next Step:

- [Qubit](https://remygatins.github.io/GatinsLabProtocols/lab_equip_qubit.html)
- need to dilute DNA? -> dilute with [low TE buffer](https://remygatins.github.io/GatinsLabProtocols/lab_molec_low_te_buffer.html)
- PCR then [gel](https://remygatins.github.io/GatinsLabProtocols/lab_molec_gel_electrophoresis.html) or [qPCR](https://remygatins.github.io/GatinsLabProtocols/lab_molec_eDNA_qpcr.html)
  - if doing PCR then gel, follow the qPCR profile and amounts (replace the probe with water, and use PCR strip tubes instead of a plate
