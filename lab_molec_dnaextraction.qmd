# Qiagen DNeasy extraction

**(using Qiagen blood and tissue kit)**

[Edit this Page](https://github.com/remygatins/GatinsLabProtocols/blob/main/lab_molec_dnaextraction.qmd)

Protocol adapted from [Lotterhos lab protocol](https://drk-lo.github.io/lotterhoslabprotocols/molecprot_dnaextractionqiagen.html) & [DNeasy® Blood & Tissue Kit (Quick-Start Protocol April 2016)](https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=68f29296-5a9f-40fa-8b3d-1c148d0b3030&lang=en)

## Tissue Lysing

!!!! ASK ABOUT ORDER: TISSUE IN TUBES FIRST OR BUFFERS

**Need:**

- [ ] scale
- [ ] sterile forcepts (store in 50 ml tube with 10% bleach then rinse with DI water spray bottle over waste container OR spray with 70% EtoH and use a flame to burn off any residual EtoH and tissue.)
- [ ] scalpel or razer (clean between samples with same steps as forcepts)
- [ ] weighting boats
- [ ] 1 ml tubes
- [ ] ice container
- [ ] [Qiagen blood and tissue kit](https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/dna-purification/genomic-dna/dneasy-blood-and-tissue-kit?catno=69506) (box labeled for eDNA use)
  - [ ] Buffer ATL (if there are precipitates heat at 56 C and mix gently)
  - [ ] Proteinase K

**Steps:**

- [ ] 1. preheat thermomixer to 56 °C
- [ ] 2. clean area with 10% bleach, water, then 70% ethanol
- [ ] 3. prep ice container to store tissue samples while working
- [ ] 4. remove tissue samples from freezer and let thaw; once thawed place on ic
- [ ] 4. while waiting for samples to thaw
  - [ ] 4.1. label 1 ml tubes
  - [ ] 4.2. add 180 µl of Buffer ATL & 20 µl of Proteinase K into labeled 1 ml tubes
- [ ] 5. tare weighing boat on scale
- [ ] 6. carefully remove tissue from storage tube with forcepts and use sterile blade to cut a piece of tissue roughly 20mg in weight. Using 100% EtoH, gently rinse tissue and pat dry with clean kim wipe, so that the tissue appears nearly dry
- [ ] 7. plase tissue on weighing boat and measure weight (should weigh around 20mg +/-2mg, if not remove or add tissue as nessesary) 
- [ ] 8. once correct weight, place tissue in prepped 1 ml tube
- [ ] 9. record weight in lab notebook
- [ ] 10. seal tube and store on ice until all samples are complete
- [ ] 11. clean instruments between each tissue sample by soaking in 10% bleach, spraying with DI water (holding over waste container/glassware), then wiping down with kimwipe. (could also sterilize with DI water, 70% ethanol, then then running instrument through an ethanol lamp filled with 100% ethanol)
- [ ] 12. repeat steps 5 through 11 for every sample
- [ ] 13. confirm that all tubes are sealed, then vortex for 15 seconds
- [ ] 14. place samples on thermo-mixer set at 56 °C at 600 rpm (check after 2 mins to make sure everything is sealed)
- [ ] 15. Samples can be left for at least 2 hours or overnight to allow for all tissue to be completely lysed.
